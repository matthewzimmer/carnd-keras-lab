We've prepared a Jupyter notebook that will guide you through the process of building and training a Traffic Sign Classification network with Keras.

- Download the [Jupyter notebook](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/580ad790_traffic-sign-classification-with-keras/traffic-sign-classification-with-keras.ipynb).
- Download the [training data](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/580ad86d_train/train.p).
- Download the [test data](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/October/580ad89e_test/test.p).


Run this command in the terminal to get started:

```jupyter notebook traffic-sign-classification-with-keras.ipynb```

This will bring up a browser window with the Jupyter notebook. The notebook will guide you in using Keras to create a deep neural network for traffic sign classification.

This is a self-assessed lab.
